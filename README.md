# Wolves and Moose of Isle Royale Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the predator-prey dynamics between wolves and moose on Isle Royale, a remote island in Lake Superior. The study leverages data collected over several decades to explore population trends, environmental influences, and the interactions between these two species. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, regression, and classification techniques to draw insights about the ecological dynamics on the island.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on two primary datasets:

1. **Wolf-Moose Yearly Dataset**: Contains yearly counts of wolf and moose populations, along with environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, and snow depth.

2. **Moose Deaths Dataset**: Provides demographic and physical characteristics of deceased moose, including age, sex, cranial volume, and standardized environmental conditions.

## Key Features

- **Population Dynamics**: Analysis of wolf and moose population trends over time.
- **Environmental Impact**: Examination of how weather variables and climate indices affect population dynamics.
- **Predation Analysis**: Investigation into the relationship between wolf population and moose predation rates.
- **Statistical Inference**: Hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation to infer population parameters.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use of regression and classification techniques to predict predation rates and other outcomes.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual and numerical summaries to understand data distributions and relationships.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Testing theories about the impact of wolf populations on moose predation rates.
4. **Regression Analysis**: Modeling the relationship between predation rates and predictors like wolf population and weather.
5. **Classification**: Using decision trees to predict moose predation based on kill rates and wolf populations.

## Results

- **Positive Correlation**: A significant positive correlation between wolf population and moose predation rate.
- **Weather Influence**: A negative correlation between winter temperatures and wolf populations.
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Decision tree models achieved an accuracy of 82.9% in predicting moose predation outcomes.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights the complex interactions between wolves, moose, and their environment on Isle Royale. Key findings suggest that wolf populations significantly influence moose predation rates, while weather conditions also play a role in population dynamics.

## Future Work

- **Data Collection**: Incorporating more detailed annual temperature data and other ecological factors.
- **Further Questions**: Exploring human impact on moose populations and detailed food chain interactions.
